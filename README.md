git-deploy
==========

It is a tool to manage using git as a deployment management tool implemented in Python and utilizing the dulwich [1] project for native git functionality in Python.

Client Configuration
--------------------

The client is any working machine from which deployments may be initiated.  To configure a client,
begin by cloning the repository to your client environment:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Git-Tools/git-deploy.git

Next, navigate to the root folder and install the package.

    $ sudo pip install -e .

Next, execute the initialization script, this will prepare the git config and copy the git deploy script.  Make sure that
the relevant values are set in git-deploy.ini for your client/server-target beforehand (see below).

    $ sudo ./scripts/init.py

The .ini file defines the dependencies for the deploy section in your global .gitconfig:

    deploy.target {%target host%} # e.g. my.remotehost.com:8080 a.k.a deploy host

    deploy.path {%remote deploy path%}

    deploy.user {%authorized user on deploy target%}

    deploy.hook-dir .git/deploy/hooks/

    deploy.tag-prefix {%project name%}

    deploy.remote {%remote name%}

    deploy.branch {%deploy branch name%}

    deploy.client-path {%client path%}

    deploy.remote-url {%remote url%}    e.g. git@github.com:Git-Tools/git-deploy.git

Also ensure that the global git params user.name and user.email are defined.


Usage
-----

Basic usage involves cloning the remote working repo to the deploy target and all client nodes.  When
a client is ready to deploy 'start' is invoked to obtain a lock on the remote and 'sync' is called to
push changes to the target.  On completion the lock is removed.

To start a new deployment, navigate to the working repo, issue a 'start' command:

    $ git deploy start [opts]

At this point you are free to make commits to the project and when ready for deployment issue 
a 'sync' command - or simply 'sync' if you're work is already complete but, be sure to rebase
your local clone:

    $ git deploy sync [opts]

The process may be aborted at any point with an 'abort' command:

    $ git deploy abort [opts]

You can rollback to a tag with the revert call:

    $ git deploy revert [-t <tag_name>] [opts]

If no tag is supplied the rollback uses the most recent tag.  The default is to only commit the rollback locally
however, by suppling the "-a" option for auto-sync the rollback automatically syncs also:

    $ git deploy revert [-t <tag_name>] [opts]

Deploy Hooks
------------

In the working path of your local clone deploy hooks may be added to '.git/deploy/hooks'.  You are
free to write your own hooks however, simple default hooks have been provided in 'git-deploy/default-hooks',
these can be copied to the hook folder in each client and target.


Example
-------

The following example illustrates how git-deploy can be configured and used for a single client and target.  For this
example the client host and target host will be referred to as *client.realm.org* and *target.realm.org* respectively.
The home path on the client and target for our sample project is */home/me/project/* and */var/www/html/sample.com/*
respectively.  It is assumed that the git remote is configured for your project and for this example the remote alias is
*origin* and the remote branch is *master*.


**CLIENT SETUP**

On *client.realm.org* clone git deploy, local install, configure settings and initialize:

    $ git clone git@github.com:Git-Tools/git-deploy.git

    ...

    $ cd git-deploy

    $ sudo pip install -e .

    ...

Next configure the client instance with git config by assigning the following settings in *scripts/git-deploy.ini*:

    [deploy]

    target=target.realm.org

    path=/home/me/project/

    user=me

    hook-dir=.git/deploy/hooks/

    tag-prefix=sample.com

    remote=origin

    branch=master

    client-path=/home/me/project/

    key-path=/home/me/.ssh/id_rsa

    test-repo-path=/tmp/test_repo/

    [system]

    run_root=/usr/bin/

Once you have defined settings in *git-deploy.ini* call *init.py* to set the got config

    $ sudo ./scripts/init.py


**TARGET SETUP**

On *target.realm.org* there is no need to clone and install git-deploy but here the deploy hooks will need to be
created.  There is a default hook in *git-deploy/default-hooks/default-target-pull.py* that should be copied to
*target.realm.org:/var/www/html/sample.com/.git/deploy/hooks/*.  This is a basic hook that will pull the changes
pushed from the client instance on sync.


**USING GIT DEPLOY**

First initialize a new repository on *client.realm.org*:

    client.realm.org:~ me$ mkdir me.com

    client.realm.org:~ me$ cd me.com

    client.realm.org:~ me$ git init

    client.realm.org:~ me$ git remote add origin git@github.com:wikimedia/me.com.git

    client.realm.org:~ me$ git push origin master

Next initialize the client repo by following the client setup above.  Subsequently, initialize the deploy target
on *target.realm.org* as indicated.

    target.realm.org:~ me$ cp ~/default-client-pull.py /var/www/html/sample.com/.git/deploy/hooks/

    target.realm.org:~ me$ chmod +x /var/www/html/sample.com/.git/deploy/hooks/default-client-pull.py


*Sync*:

Ensure that the client is correctly synced to the remote by issuing a git pull or rebase.  Then you can issue a
a start command to write the lock file to the target to begin the deployment.

    client.realm.org:~ me$ cd me.com

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ touch new_file

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git add new_file

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git commit -m "add - my new file"

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git pull --rebase origin master

At this point you are ready to enter the deployment process:

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy start

    <perform any testing or add any other commits as necessary>

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy sync

Once you sync a the specified hooks will be invoked from the client and the target and a tag is written to the
repository on the latest commit of the deploy. If the default push and pull hooks are used the client will simply
push its changes to the remote and the target will pull in the new changes.  Deployment tags have the form
*<repo>-sync-<date>-<time>*.


*Abort*

At times it is necessary to exit the deploy cycle prematurely.  For instance, consider the following:

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy start

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git commit bad_change -m "add - some buggy code."

Suddenly, you realize that your change introduced a bug after entering the deloy process.  Rather than syncing the bad
code and then rolling back (next section) we can simply abort the deploy:

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy abort

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git reset --soft HEAD^

    ... continue with your local changes ...

Now you have released deploy to other clients without infecting the code base with your buggy code.


*Rollback*

If you accidentally deploy some code that needs to be rolled back the *revert* command cn be very helpful here.  You
can rollback to previous deploy states by utilizing deploy tags.  To view the old tags:

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git tag

Now to rollback to a previous deploy call *git revert* with the appropriate tag:

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy start

    client.realm.org:me.com me$ git deploy revert <tag>
